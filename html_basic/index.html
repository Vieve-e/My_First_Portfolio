    <h1>Welcome to My Awesome Site</h1>
    <h2>This site would be about discussing my cat</h2>
    <h3>My cat was a blend of a tabby and a ginger cat</h3>
    <p>This is will be about my lovely cat Neko.</p>
    <p>Neko was sassy, fierce and a queen in her own right</p>
    <p>She loved rubs and wanted to be carried at all time, she was spoilt</p>
    <p>She spent half of her day grooming herself and purring</p>
